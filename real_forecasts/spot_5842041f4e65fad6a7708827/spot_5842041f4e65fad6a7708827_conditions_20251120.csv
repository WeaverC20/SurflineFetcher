1763625600,2025-11-20,True,False,"Chewed up conditions from S wind. Modest surf, draining out on the dropping tide.","Mix of leftover NW and a bit of SW swell keeps things rideable. Most breaks max out around waist high. Moderate to breezy southerly wind chewing up conditions this afternoon, sticking around through the end of the day.<br>
<br>
Get somewhere with S wind protection if you still want to surf, and do it sooner than later as the draining tide makes for drumpy surf from mid-afternoon into the evening.",-8,
1763712000,2025-11-21,True,True,Jumbled start from mix of mid/longer period NW swell. Conditions look dicey with SE wind.,"Jumbled surf, starting off with mostly shorter/mid period NW energy as longer period swell builds and takes over in the afternoon. A bit steeper-angled NW so that'll make it more selective, especially across Orange County, north HB standouts get the most size later in the day.<br>
<br>
A fresh round of SSW swell builds -- fun zone in the AM and bumping up through the afternoon.<br>
<br>
SE wind looks likely, but worth waking up and giving it a look. Enough E in the wind and it's on, keep protection in mind.",-8,
1763798400,2025-11-22,True,True,Fun weekend of combo surf setting up. Pesky AM high tide and watching the local wind/conditions.,"Fun zone NW swell from Friday lingers and new round of SSW swell shows better across the region. Should be a pretty fun combo of swells on tap with peaks/bowls at the better beachbreaks.<br>
<br>
Wind currently looks cooperative but we'll need to watch a coastal low late week. <br>
<br>
Big tide swings in play. The morning high tide will slow many spots after a decent dawn patrol window then things get drained through the afternoon.",-8,
1763884800,2025-11-23,True,True,"More fun combo surf. A bit more SPAC-centric, the stronger NW energy selective.","SSW swell comes up another peg and offers playful surf across the region. There's enough NPAC energy to keep the surf reasonably broken up at the beachbreaks but the strongest energy from the NW is going to be more selective. Old NW swell lingers, new long period NW swell creeps in.<br>
<br>
Wind looks mostly favorable for now.<br>

Big tide swings in play. The morning high tide will slow many spots after a decent dawn patrol window then things get drained through the afternoon.",-8,
1763971200,2025-11-24,True,True,Picking up where Sunday leaves off as fun combo continues. Clean AM with punchy peaks.,"Looking for SSW swell to bump up again from Sunday as selective NW swell also tops out for some nice-sized peaks when the swells cross up.<br>
<br>
Looks like a day to hit it early before the tide gets too deep, winds look pretty good all morning.<br>
<br>
WNW onshores due to pick up in the afternoon, possibly light enough to keep texture manageable, but you'll probably need some structure if you have to surf the tide drop.",-8,
1764057600,2025-11-25,True,True,"Size starts to come down, still enough SSW and NW energy around for fun peaks.","SSW swell starts out similar to late Monday for more waist-chest high surf, pushing head-high to a bit overhead for standouts. NW energy is down a peg and eases through the day, but there should still be enough juice to make for peaky surf on the AM tide push.<br>
<br>
Early window looks best at this point with light wind, clean conditions. Models are in decent agreement on westerly onshore being slow to pick up in the afternoon, could keep the tide drop in play.",-8,

1764316800,2025-11-28,True,True,Watching for another fun SSW pulse around the 28th-30th. Potential for some NW energy too.,"Higher confidence in a fun pulse of SSW swell building through Fri the 28th, topping out on the 29th. We could also get a bit of selective NW swell mixing in at the same time. Probably not a proper combo setup, but sectiony to semi-peaky shape is possible.<br>
<br>
We'll refine details over the next several days. Hopefully, the outlook on the NW pulse improves.",-8,
